## About
### This is the code for my personal website
### I used a React template as a very barebones starting point, and I really just used the navbar and header/footer pages from it. I though they looked very nice. The rest I coded myself!
### Coded with JavaScript, React.js, HTML5/CSS.
### Used Bootstrap as a CSS framework, to beautify my page. Normally, I would have used Materialize CSS, however it was being difficult. So I figured why not play around with a new technology, Bootstrap.

## Hosting
### This website is actually running on a web server from my Raspberry Pi 2! 
### I bought the domain from Google Domains. Then, I generated a static IP address for my Pi, and created a DNS entry for my domain and the IP of the Pi
### On the Pi, I used PuTTY to log into its terminal, and downloaded and ran an Apache2 Web Server.
### I used npm run build to grab a build folder for my project, and transferred that to the ver/www/html folder on the Pi, the default folder for the Apache2 Web Server. I used WinSCP to transfer.
### Lastly, I just port forwarded port 80 on my router, and voila! A working web server.
