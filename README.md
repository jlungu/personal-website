##About
#This is the code for my personal website, located at www.jamesjjlungu.com
#I used a React template as a very barebones starting point, and I really just used the navbar and header/footer pages from it. I though they looked very nice. The rest I coded myself!
#Coded with JavaScript, React.jsm HTML5/CSS.
#Used Bootstrap as a CSS framework, to beautify my page. Normally, I would have use Materialize CSS, however it was being difficult. So I figured why not play around with a new technology, Bootstrap.
