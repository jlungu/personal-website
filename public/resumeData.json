    "bio":"Iâ€™m currently a fourth year student studying Computer Science and Chemistry at Stony Brook University in New York State. Based in New York City, New York, I started exploring the wonderful world of Computer Science in my second year of college and have been coding ever since! Although I definitely have my work cut out for me in my classes, outside of them I love playing my Mellophone in the Spirit of Stony Brook Marching Band, aiding students in the Fundamentals of Computer Networks as a TA, reading up about investments and equity, or just curling up with a good book. Scroll down to learn a bit more about me, my projects, and what I can do!",
