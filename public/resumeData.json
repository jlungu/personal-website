    "bio":"Hello! My name is James Lungu, and I am currently a third year student studying Computer Science and Chemistry at Stony Brook University in New York State. Based in New York City, New York, I got the coding bug when I was in high school and haven't been able to stop since! As a Computer Science Major and a Chemistry Minor, I do indeed have my work cut out for me in my classes, however outside of them I love playing my Mellophone in the Spirit of Stony Brook Marching Band, helping students along the road to sucess in Organic Chemistry as a TA, reading up about investments and equity, or just curling up with a good book. Scroll down to learn a bit more about me, my projects, and what I can do! I thank you in advance for visiting my website!",
